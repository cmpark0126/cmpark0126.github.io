I am a Master Student at [Concurrency and Parallelism Laboratory](https://cp.kaist.ac.kr/), [KAIST School of Computing](https://cs.kaist.ac.kr/).

My research interests are in designing and verifying concurrent and parallel systems. In particular, I want to solve various real-world problems associated with these topics. I believe these studies will help advance the areas such as Deep Learning where performance issues are critical.
